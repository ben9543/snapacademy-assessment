# Overview

- The task is to 
    1. develop a single-page website for your favorite small business in LA that does not already have its own website and 
    2. deploy it online. Please make sure to include a note on your website that it is an unofficial webpage for the small business.

- You are allowed to use a template, but we're looking to see your ability to incorporate new features to the template. If you do use a template, there will be a place for you to link the original template in the reflection.

- **Note**: If you have never used HTML, CSS, or Github Pages before, great! Find online resources that you like to guide you through the process. Here are some sites to get you started: 
https://pages.github.com/
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css#basic-html-page-structure

- If it's your first time creating a website, try to implement as many of these features as you can: 

    - About the Business section
    - Images and descriptions of 3-4 items/services offered
    - A CSS file for styling your website. Use this file to change the color palette and fonts for your website; they cannot be the same as the ones from a template if you choose to use one. 
    - At least one HTML button
    - Use of GitHub Pages or Netlify to host your website

- If you're experienced with web dev, here are some features we'd like to see. Definitely don't try to implement them all! Pick 1-3 you're excited about and implement those. Again, you are allowed to use a template but weâ€™ll be looking for your contributions beyond the template. 

    - Use of JavaScript 
    - A photo gallery
    - More advanced styling such as use of flexbox/grid CSS, bootstrap, fonts/typography  background/gradient etc. See https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css#basic-html-page-structure for more information. 
    - Use of git commits
    - A mobile responsive site
    - onScroll animations
    - onHover animations
    - Navigation menu and multiple pages
